It's just a small project I'm using to learn material-ui and React, don't blame me if it doesn't work properly ;)
https://timmmmyeo.github.io/ - the main page
https://timmmmyeo.github.io/edit - the editor for cards

TODO:
- Add button to reveal the content of the card
- After revealed, ask user "correct? "Not correct?" and keep a score to show on the final page 
- (toast: "nice!" if they get it right, "better luck next time!" otherwise)
- Create final page, and don't allow users to switch back to a previous flashcard (maybe make this an option later)
- Make content of the card bigger to fill the screen
- Add a menu to switch between the editor and using the flashcards
