It's just a small project I'm using to learn material-ui and React, don't blame me if it doesn't work properly ;)

https://timmmyeo.github.io/flash/#/ - the main page

https://timmmyeo.github.io/flash/#/edit - the editor for cards

TODO:
- After revealed, ask user "correct? "Not correct?" and keep a score to show on the final page 
- (toast: "nice!" if they get it right, "better luck next time!" otherwise)
- Create final page, and don't allow users to switch back to a previous flashcard (maybe make this an option later)
- Make content of the card bigger to fill the screen
- Abstract out the flashcard app perhaps so that buttons and functionality are added as props
- If the user tries to refresh, add an alert "You will lose the current state"
- Add a toast when the user deletes a card
